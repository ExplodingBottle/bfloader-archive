This is bfloader, a script collection plus loader backend to get images into
your flash quickly using the ICEbear JTAG adapter. It depends on an
installation of the GDB JTAG toolchain (see bottom link).

The backend interface is basically the same as from VDSP's flash loader plugin.
You may easily adapt existing VDSP loader backends to the GNU toolchain.

This source code is provided 'as is' without support or warranty.
You may use the source code in whatever way you like, but we would prefer
to keep it OpenSource. If you have made a setup for another board, let
us know.

Currently, a small number of directly memory mapped flashes are supported.
The code does not tend to be very generic, but rather simple.
Basically, you only adapt your flash map in the file main.c of your board
directory when supporting another board.


Usage:

0. Check for a plugged in ICEbear and running gdbproxy
1. Enter the appropriate directory matching your board's type
2. Edit 'flashload.sh' and change the location of your flash image(s)
3. Edit '.gdbinit', if necessary
4. Run the flashload.sh script
